The purpose of the present letter is to recommend that Joel Saldaña Pérez be 
considered for the position of Academic Skills Coach in the University of 
Arizona Think Tank. I had the pleasure of having Joel in my Spanish 343 class 
this Fall semester of 2011 and can attest to his commitment to excellence as a 
student. The class that I teach, Introduction to Spanish Phonetcs and Phonology, 
is by no means an easy course. Joel’s dedication to learning the intricate 
details of the Spanish language is an excellent example of his intellectual 
capabilities and his excellent work ethic.  

Joel is an intelligent, outgoing student and I feel that he will have no trouble 
working as an academic skills coach. In fact, because of his outgoing 
personality and academic potential, I feel that Joel is the ideal candidate for 
this type of position. For these very reasons he was selected to work personally 
with the Director of the Spanish for Heritage Language Learners Program, Sara 
Beaudrie, as a preceptor in her Spanish Phonetics course for the Spring Semester 
of 2012.  

I hope that you will consider Joel for the position of Academic Skills Coach. If 
you have any questions with regards to the aforementioned information or any 
other concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at your earliest 
convenience.  

Thank you for your consideration.  


Best regards,
