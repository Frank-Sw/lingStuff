lingStuff
=========

This is a collection of functions that I often use 
in my research. Some are borrowed and edited, others 
are my own. Feel free to fork and edit as you see fit. 

## Installation

In order to install this package you must have `devtools`. Don't know if you have `devtools`? Copy and paste this into your console:

```
if (!require('devtools')) {
  stop('The package foo was not installed')
}
```

R will load `devtools` if you have it, otherwise it will give you an error, in which case you should copy and paste the following code into the console:

```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("jvcasill/lingStuff")
```

In the case that you already have `devtools`, then just copy and paste lines 2 and 3 of the above code chunk. 

## To add

- contrast coef calculation

## Examples

### D' (d prime)

```{r 'dPrime example', warning=FALSE}
library(lingStuff); library(dplyr)

# Create some data
set.seed(1)
axb <- data.frame(subj = sort(rep(1:10, each = 20, times = 10)),
                  group = gl(2, 1000, labels = c("g1", "g2")),
                  hit = c(rbinom(1000, size = c(0, 1), prob = .8), 
                          rbinom(1000, size = c(0, 1), prob = .6)),
                  fa =  c(rbinom(1000, size = c(0, 1), prob = .3), 
                          rbinom(1000, size = c(0, 1), prob = .4))
    )

# Calculate d prime for each subject
# by group, plot it, and run a 
# linear model
axb %>%
  group_by(subj, group) %>%
  summarize(hRate = mean(hit), 
            faRate = mean(fa), 
            dp = dPrime(hRate, faRate)) %T>%
  {
    plot(dp ~ as.numeric(group), data = ., 
    main = "d' as a function of group", xaxt = "n", 
    xlab = "Group", ylab = "d' prime")
    axis(1, at = 1:2, labels = c("g1", "g2"))
    abline(lm(dp ~ as.numeric(group), data = .), col = "red")
  } %>%
  lm(dp ~ group, data = .) %>%
  summary()
```
